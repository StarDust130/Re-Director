## ✨ Make it pop — README polish

I've added extra emojis, friendlier UI wording, and short, punchy lines so the README reads more modern and approachable. Below is a slightly more playful, UI-focused variant — feel free to swap or request a different tone (serious, product-focused, or ultra-compact).

### 🔥 New README enhancements (what I changed)

- More emojis sprinkled across headings and bullets for personality ✨
- Short, clear UI-focused lines that highlight the dashboard experience 🖥️📱
- A compact Quick Start block so contributors can get running fast ⚡

If you'd like, I can replace the current README with a playful version that includes inline SVG icons, a small hero image, or GitHub Action badges (CI / tests). Tell me which style you prefer: `playful` (current), `sleek` (minimal icons, fewer emojis), or `professional` (badge-heavy, formal tone).
